# Swirl Effect

A Web Worker example for applying a radial twist distortion (swirl) to images.

## Description
Creates a vortex-like effect by rotating pixels around a center point, with the rotation angle decaying as the distance from the center increases.

## Key Features
- **Adjustable Twist**: Control the angle and direction (positive/negative) of the swirl.
- **Configurable Geometry**: Set the center point and radius of the effect.
- **Smooth Rendering**: Uses bilinear interpolation to minimize aliasing.

## Usage
1. Upload an image.
2. Adjust Angle, Radius, and Center position.
3. Click "Apply Effect".
