# Wave Deformation

A Web Worker example for applying wave distortion to images.

## Description
Applies a sinusoidal displacement to image pixels, creating a ripple or flag-waving effect. The calculation is performed in a worker, allowing for smooth animation.

## Key Features
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Control Amplitude, Frequency, and Phase of the wave.
- **Directional Modes**: Horizontal, Vertical, or Combined (Grid) waves.
- **Animation Support**: Continuously updates the phase to simulate movement.

## Usage
1. Upload an image.
2. Configure wave parameters.
3. Click "Apply Effect" for a static result or "Animate" to see it in motion.
